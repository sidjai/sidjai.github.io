##Siddarta Jairam

By education, I am an engineer. I was enthralled with the notion that "Code always does what you tell it to do, not always what you want it to do." I saw this as a remarkable puzzle that updates with every new project. I was also exposed to the simplicity of modeling while being very easy to corrupt. This pulled me towards a role in data. For the perceivable future, I am wholly satisfied with trying to break down the scientific method in a way that a computer can understand.
