##Siddarta Jairam

Currently, I am a modeler with the USDA. By education, I am an engineer. Mostly, I just enjoy doing science without all the holdups that real experiments give. I was enthralled with the notion that "Code always does what you tell it to do, not always what you want it to do." For the perceivable future, I am wholly satisfied with trying to break down the scientific method in a way that a computer can understand.
